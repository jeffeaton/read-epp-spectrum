These scripts include functions for reading output files of EPP and Spectrum software.

Country estimates files are available from UNAIDS: http://apps.unaids.org/spectrum/

The functions are created for reading output files Spectrum version 5.0 (2014 round of UNAIDS estimates).

The functions are not particularly well tested. If you see something funny, investigate it (and let me know!).
